		<description>No, I just mean server side code and client side code being kept in sync.</description>

		<description>i must be misunderstanding what you&#039;re getting after... i still don&#039;t see how there is any possibility of sync issues, with the fetch. 

are you talking about a scenario where you&#039;ve deployed new code to the server, while a user is currently on a page that uses a backbone setup?</description>

		<description>You&#039;re right in that respect.

One of the reasons I chose backbone instead of knockout was because of the fetch capability of the model and synching with the server.   I could be wrong but there seems less room for synchronisation issues this way.</description>

		<description>true. when this happens, would you let your ERB/HAML/ASP.NET MVC views lay stale, still trying to find &quot;first_name&quot; when the model is now called &quot;firstname&quot; ? not likely... the backbone code should get the same 1st class treatment as the standard views, and should be updated accordingly.</description>

		<description>First name is a bad example, but model code changes, attributes get added, modified and removed all the time.  </description>

		<description>yes, your right... but why would you do that? this would cause all kinds of problems not related to my plugin. the json that comes back from the server should be what the client side uses. if your model&#039;s properties are &#039;firstname&#039; and &#039;lastname&#039; on the server, then they should be this in the javascript / backbone code as well.</description>

		<description>I mean if in this example I removed or renamed the first_name attribute to firstname from the server side (ruby, C# etc.) class then I need to update my client side mark up to update the data-binding attribute to data-binding=&quot;firstname&quot; or am I missing something?</description>

		<description>i&#039;m not quite following you.. can you explain that scenario a little more? what is being updated, when, and when is the data being transferred to / from the server?</description>

		<description>The only problem I see is that the server model attributes change and you need to update the dat-bind attributes.  Synching with the JSON would be nice</description>
