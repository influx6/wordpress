		<description>sadly, no... i didn&#039;t intend that behavior, and now i see how mistaken i was when i wrote that code and this article. :-/

I&#039;ve posted a note at the top of this article saying I was wrong... but i need to do something more than that, i think.</description>

		<description>I probably got it all wrong, but when I go to your BackboneTraining.net site and I navigate through it, hitting back/forward doesn&#039;t do anything- the view stays the same. I tried Firefox 7, Opera, the lastest chrome and nada. Is this the expected behaviour?</description>
