		<description>It&#039;s recommended to namespace it to your app:


We use rt.app.events as a global event handler.  Everything under rt.app is an instance variable of some sort so it falls right inline with the structure of our application.  


Other than that as long as you keep global events properly named you should avoid any confusion as to what they do.</description>

		<description>Hi,


I have a question a very basic one though and please correct me if I am wrong. Isn&#039;t vent object a global object ? And isn&#039;t having global variables considered wrong ?

		<description>not as a global variable. this is sample code just to show how to define it. you should attach it to a namespace object for your app, or some other object that represents your app and is available to use from your other objects (a module, for example).</description>
