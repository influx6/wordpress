		<description>You. Are. My. Hero! :) I&#039;m just a noob practicing backbone and have been struggling with this exact problem for the past hour. This was the best explanation ever and with it I got it fixed.

Thank you Derick!</description>

		<description>&gt; Object literals in JavaScript are also known by a number of other names: hashes, associative arrays, key/value sets, JSON,I really like your articles, but this put me off. It is simply not true that an object is a hash and saying that is very misleading. See http://www.devthought.com/2012/01/18/an-object-is-not-a-hash/ </description>

		<description>Oops. She told me it worked using the class selector, but I guess she didn&#039;t understand. Mea culpa, typo</description>

		<description>We can&#039;t get the id based selector to work (&quot;click #someButton&quot; in your example). When we replace it w/ a class-based selector (&quot;click .someButtonClass&quot;), it works. This seems fairly fundamental but is mystifying us [next step, look at the source code.]</description>

		<description>orlybriceno: off the top of my head, I don&#039;t know why the events aren&#039;t being triggered, but here is a good blog post by derick that covers a common problem with events not being triggered:

		<description>Hey there, thanks for the explanation. I want to ask you something would this work for backbone 0.5.3? that&#039;s the version we&#039;re using, and I&#039;m specifying both tagName and className, the elements are being created and rendered correctly (I do an alert with this.el in the render method and see the markup is as I indicated), and as you said I have a single element view that renders itself and a &#039;directory&#039; view that call the single one and appends the singles to the document ; but still the events are not being triggered, and I don&#039;t have any control of the ready section since Im working as a part of a bigger project and the architecture is basically inamovible . Thanks in advance.</description>

		<description>Thanks so much for this post. I&#039;m writing my first Backbone app and I&#039;ve been pulling my hair out wondering why nothing was working.</description>

		<description>Ha, I actually just realized what I did - I loaded all my script tags on the bottom of the main html page and your code was the last one so, like you said,  I guess that&#039;s another way to avoid the problem.  :)</description>

		<description>it&#039;s hit or miss, and depends on the size and complexity of the html / js involved. you run the risk of the DOM not being available when the JS is evaluated. if you put that JS at the  bottom of the HTML, you&#039;re less likely to have a problem, but it&#039;s still possible. 

i&#039;d rather not have that risk. :)</description>

		<description>Great article!  But the first batch of code that isn&#039;t supposed to work  actually works (at least for me).  Even in IE.</description>
