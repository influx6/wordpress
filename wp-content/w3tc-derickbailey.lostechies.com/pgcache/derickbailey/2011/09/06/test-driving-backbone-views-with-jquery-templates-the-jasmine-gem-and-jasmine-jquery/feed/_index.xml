		<description>i&#039;ve used symbolic links for this, as well. it works well in *nix based systems (osx, linux, etc). when sharing code with windows users, though, they have to set up the link with a tool that doesn&#039;t come directly with windows. tradeoffs... but it&#039;s definitely a good option</description>

		<description>Not sure loading fixtures would work when using rake jasmine and MVC: since rake jasmine uses WEBrick and ASP.NET MVC another server, you&#039;ll get a cross-origin error when attempting to load the MVC fixture.
I suppose there is a way around it though, need to have a look at it.</description>

		<description>I tried this method of importing templates as fixtures, but didn&#039;t really like it. Another avenue for template loading which I prefer, is to use Sprockets from Rails 3.1.


Sprockets (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) has specific handling for javascript templates. To use your template &#039;partials&#039; in your tests just require the template and use the JST array:

    //= require templates/my_template
    $(&quot;#content&quot;).html(JST[&quot;templates/my_template&quot;](someDatas));

…which is also the exact same way you require and utilize templates in your production JS code. It also feels nice and clean.

Also, I wanted to use Handlebars as my template language of choice and thus required a Handlebars engine to Rails 3.1: https://github.com/leshill/handlebars_assets</description>

		<description>Re: template loading, you might be interested in this followup post to the one you linked, if you haven&#039;t seen it: http://encosia.com/jquery-templates-composite-rendering-and-remote-loading/

That way you minimize the number of HTTP requests necessary to pull down logically related groups of templates, but you also don&#039;t have to burden the initial page load with templates that aren&#039;t used immediately. Of course, for templates that *are* used immediately as the page loads, I agree that it does make sense to go ahead and embed those in the view.</description>

		<description>http://lostechies.com/johnteague/2010/06/28/unit-testing-your-mvc-views-with-qunit/ if you ever need to do it in MVC.  It&#039;s a bit old school now and should be easier with the newer view engines.</description>
