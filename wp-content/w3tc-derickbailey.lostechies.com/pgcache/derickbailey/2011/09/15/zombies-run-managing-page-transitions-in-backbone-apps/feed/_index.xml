		<description>semantics, and purpose.

the remove method is a convenience method that wraps &quot;this.$el.remove()&quot; and is used to remove the view&#039;s &quot;el&quot; from the DOM. this has a very different set of semantics than &quot;close&quot; does.</description>

		<description>Is there a reason why you chose to create a &#039;close&#039; method rather than overriding the &#039;remove&#039; method?</description>

		<description>Thank you Derick. We are also working with backbone on a large scale app and the first thing we hit upon was this very issue. 
This was a great help and nice read.</description>

		<description>You should mention this in an update on this post - I was having same issues with this, but the updated code is way more solid!</description>

		<description>This approach seems to work really well, I&#039;ve combined it with also having an optional onClose event so that individual views can tidy up anything specific such as events bound directly to the window.</description>

		<description>ah, sorry. somehow missed that you were passing in the context variable. that might work. i don&#039;t know for sure, but you could test it out and see pretty easily :)</description>

		<description>Hi Derick, thank you. Maybe I&#039;m wrong, but the code above only removes the callbacks for the model of *one specific view*, not all. If you look at the backbone documentation:


// Removes all callbacks for `context` for all events.
object.off(null, null, context);

// Removes all callbacks on `object`.
object.off();

So when a view calls this.model.off(null, null, this), where &quot;this&quot; references
the view, only the callbacks for the model of this view are removed,
and no other views are affected.</description>
