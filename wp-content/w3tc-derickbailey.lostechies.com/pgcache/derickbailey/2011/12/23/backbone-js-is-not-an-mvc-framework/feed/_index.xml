		<description>Hi,

I know this is an old post but I found it during my googling and I&#039;d like to give my thoughts on it.

I find Backbone appealing because I come from a Django background and I find it very similar to it, since Django has its own router (a urlpattern tuple), a set of templates, views that are responsible for rendering a template and models.



Django refers to itself not strictly an MVC but MTV (Model-Template-View), which is a bit different but from the same &quot;family&quot; of frameworks.</description>

		<description>By now the MVW (Model-View-Whatever) has been coined. More patterns have emerged and the carrot, still dangling, seems to be isomorphic javascript:

		<description>By now the term MVW (Model-View-Whatever) has already been coined and the carrot that is isomorphic javascript, or JS that runs both on the client and server, is furiously being sought after. Will Flatiron be the first one to the finish line?

		<description>Yes, you&#039;re correct. I meant to say &quot;views&quot;. Fixed. Thanks! :)</description>

		<description>Hi Derick!
I have 1 small question/suggestion. When you say 

&quot;A router is not a controller. It’s a router. A view is not a controller.
 It’s a view. Yes, both routers and controllers share some of what a 
traditional MVC framework would call a controller&quot;

I think the 5th sentence should be corrected to &quot;yes, both routers and VIEWS share some...&quot;.

Or did you really mean &quot;controller&quot; as old name of router in Backbone?</description>

		<description>In MVC, a view wires itself to the controller, and changes as the controller changes. The controller has no reference to the view. In MVP, the presenter reaches into the view and messes with it, and can also talk to other presenters.


I don&#039;t think these discussions are super important, but I would highly recommend reading http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/uiArchs.html</description>

		<description>I argue here that Backbone does have an implicit and somewhat creepy deus ex machina controller:
