		<description>Mobile web is something I&#039;ve been wanting to get into, but haven&#039;t had a chance to do, yet. When I do, you can be sure that I&#039;ll be talking about it. It&#039;s just a question of when. :)

This post is the closest thing I have to a Backbone + Kendo post, so far. I&#039;m using the two together pretty regularly at this point, though. The ideas that I talk about in this post apply to Kendo pretty well, which is why I included Kendo in some of the examples here.

I&#039;ve only briefly read a little bit about Kendo&#039;s MVVM... I&#039;m not sure what to think, yet. I have a lot of reservations about things that I don&#039;t know enough about yet. I&#039;m &quot;cautiously optimistic&quot; would be the best answer at this point. :)</description>

		<description>Derick,

Love your stuff on Backbone. I&#039;m looking at doing a mobile app with Backbone and jQuery Mobile or Kendo UI Mobile. Have you (or will you) posted any samples of Kendo and Backbone together?

Also, any thoughts about Backbone vs Kendo&#039;s MMVM support?

Thanks,
Eric</description>

		<description>the problem that you and Alex are running in to is usually caused by the way the dialog boxes are handled, at the DOM level. 

nearly every modal dialog system takes the DOM element that you hand it, removes it from the DOM and places it somewhere else - either in memory, or in a special holding area of the DOM that&#039;s been hidden from the user.

when this happens - when the view&#039;s &quot;el&quot; is removed from the DOM, you lose all of your declared events on the view, and things don&#039;t work anymore.

the solution is not to call the dialog directly against the view. use an intermediate object (similar to the RegionManager I talk about) that represents the dialog, and then have it show the view&#039;s content in that.

var Dialog = {
  el: &quot;#dialogDiv&quot;,
  show: function(view){
    view.render();
    var $el = $(el);
    $el.html(view.el);    
    $el.dialog();
  }
}

by doing this, it&#039;s the &quot;#dialogDiv&quot; that gets moved around in the DOM when you call the $.dialog method instead of the view&#039;s &quot;el&quot;, so you don&#039;t lose your view&#039;s declared events.</description>

		<description>This is a big issue that I&#039;ve hit up against as well.
(and actually in the HackerNews thread I left the same comment because I believe the commenter there had the same type of issue: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3616497)
For example, trying to tie a Backbone View (el, events) to a Twitter Bootstrap &quot;Popover&quot;(http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers) doesn&#039;t work in the &quot;Backbone way&quot;.
Are talking about the same thing?</description>

		<description>Thanks for another great post Derick!  Can you tell me how you handle jQuery UI Dialogs with Backbone?  Specifically, what do you bind the view/element to?  I&#039;ve experimented with it a bit, and can never seem to get event binding to work correctly...</description>
