		<description>Completely agree with your opinion Derick especially in a practical matter.

I found working with RequireJS if I used a type based folder structure when it came to optimization RequireJS would have issues as &quot;person.js&quot; (model) and &quot;person.js&quot; (collection) cause name spacing issues if you were trying to build one module unless you hard coded the name in the define method which defeats it&#039;s purpose.</description>

		<description>Good stuff Derick. Organization with JS is tough sometimes, but then I take a deep breath and realize, it doesn&#039;t REALLY matter all that much as long as I and the members of my team all have a good understanding about how our app works!</description>

		<description>Completely agree about organizing code around the type of Class it is.  Lumping dozens of Models into a single folder just seems like a completely awful way of structuring your code.</description>
