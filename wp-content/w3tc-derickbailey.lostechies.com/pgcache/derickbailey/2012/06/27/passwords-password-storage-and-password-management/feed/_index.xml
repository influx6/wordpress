		<description>I signed up for a web site and they sent me a temporary password that happens to MATCH EXACTLY an obscure password I use regularly.  I this just the twighlight zone or is something fishy going on?

		<description>I use a Passwords.txt file in my dropbox folder with a hotkey to open it.  Surprising how easy that is to use, and unsecure. :)</description>

		<description>with KeyPass, specifically, there is a PortableApps version: http://portableapps.com/


this lets you bring a USB drive with your apps installed on it, and KeyPass is supported: http://portableapps.com/apps/utilities/keepass_portable


i have a friend that does this (or did, a few years ago when i worked with him)</description>

		<description>I use KeePass and really like it, but one of the main issues that I run into is that I can&#039;t install anything like that on my work computer so I have no access to any of my passwords during the work day. That becomes a pain in the butt since I also can&#039;t have my phone at my desk.</description>

		<description>I love open-source keepass. I don&#039;t think anyone should use a &quot;closed&quot; source system for passwords management. It&#039;s like trusting someone whom you don&#039;t know with all the passwords. If you are that paranoid, you should give up on some &quot;ease of use&quot;.</description>

		<description>Well if you keep all your eggs in one basket then you should watch that basket very closely! That&#039;s what I can say :)</description>

		<description>Using a password management system does seem a bit like putting all your eggs in one basket. If it&#039;s wrong for me to use the same password to access email, banking, amazon  because once that password is known all sites are compromised then how is having just 1 password to protect all my other passwords any safer?


If I put 1Password on my PC and create a password per site and store those passwords in my 1Password &#039;database&#039; and I loose my database, the file gets corrupted or stolen then how do I recover from that? If I store a copy of the password database in the cloud then someone just needs to hack my dropbox/foldershare/whatever to find a nice juicy database of passwords and sites they can then attack at will.</description>

		<description>One indicator how secure a service is: as soon as you sign up, look for a self-service &quot;Delete my account&quot; link. If it doesn&#039;t exist, assume that every other shortcut was also taken. Email the operator asking how to cancel. Get ready for their reply to crush any remaining confidence.</description>
