		<description>Typo in your gist? 

  async.it(&quot;did stuff&quot;, function(){
 instead of

  it(&quot;did stuff&quot;, function(){

		<description>if you can, do that. it&#039;s not always possible, though. There are times when it&#039;s far more difficult or creates too much of a brittle test, to spy/mock/stub the internal working of an object. in those cases, async tests are important. the prime example for me, right now, is WinJS/Promises. but also in API design for my Backbone applications, I often want to ensure my promises are working correctly for loading data through an API in my app instead of directly through a model or collection.</description>

		<description>in what way is this limiting? there&#039;s nothing you can do with runs/waitsFor that can&#039;t be done with a simple &quot;done()&quot; call.</description>

		<description>I&#039;d like to hear your opinions on my own spec runner: oojspec


https://github.com/rosenfeld/oojspec



Since it supports beforeAll and afterAll and since all examples are run in a specific order and since the &quot;runs&quot; block is guaranteed to be run in any before blocks before the examples start, I don&#039;t think the waitsFor/runs suck. Quite the opposite, I find the option you provide very limiting when you&#039;re writing integration specs specially. This is a limiting factor in Buster.js for example in my opinion, which implements the approach you suggested...</description>

		<description>If you didn&#039;t see them, there were a couple of new test runners released recently that give you similar capabilities as the Ruby gem (and more, especially multibrowser testing - cool stuff) 
Testem - https://github.com/airportyh/testem
Testacular - http://vojtajina.github.com/testacular/</description>
