		<description>@getsomerestbook:twitter is an awesome stream of good points about rest.
I also put together a presentation on doing rest wrong: http://shishkin.github.com/presentations/rest/ (doesn&#039;t work well in all browsers).</description>

		<description>Steve Vinoski has quite a few articles on REST and REST related topics here:

http://steve.vinoski.net/blog/category/rest/ 

These articles tend to be architectural in nature and from a few years ago when the REST / RPC wars were in full swing.  You might be most interested in his &quot;Checklist for REST&quot; article. </description>

		<description>I have been trying to read up on REST the last couple days and having been feeling the same way.  I found this article to be helpful for a quick overview and example.

		<description>Going back a good few years I agree there was lots of confusion about REST. You had little to go on and if you wanted more you had to visit rest-discuss which was often a fruitless experience.

Now I&#039;m not so sure, all the books you mention are good and give you plenty of context. My only complaint now is there&#039;s a surge of (rather late) bandwagon jumpers putting out there own content and its often either overly preachy or is dumbed down to the point of uselessness. Not much you can do about that except watch out for those people and ignore them.</description>

		<description>RESTful Web Services and REST in Practice are excellent. You should also look at Mike Amundsen&#039;s Building Hypermedia APIs with HTML5 and Node [1] and Subbu Allamaraju&#039;s RESTful Web Services Cookbook [2].

As far as the &quot;right&quot; way, the best you can do is read Fielding&#039;s thesis, which provides the architectural definition. Once you move past that, don&#039;t think about REST proper. Do you build perfect MVC pattern apps? Probably not. The same is true for REST. It&#039;s an architectural pattern. Grok the elements, then plan out what you need. Mike&#039;s book does an excellent job sticking to the structure of HTTP and barely mentions REST. Besides, if you stick to HTTP&#039;s strengths, you&#039;re likely to fall into REST.

But why listen to me? I&#039;m an &quot;elitist.&quot; ;)
