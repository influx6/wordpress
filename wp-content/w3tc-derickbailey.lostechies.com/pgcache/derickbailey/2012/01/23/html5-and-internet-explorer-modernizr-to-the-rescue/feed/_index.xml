		<description>The HTML5shiv project is kind of worked on in collaboration with Modernizr, so its the exact same code. Modernizr does do extra stuff, though so if you like any of its detects, the extra 1k or whatever is probably worth it. :)</description>

		<description>I used http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ a few days ago
Worked very well ONCE I had validated the page!!
IE also hates HTML 5 if you have unterminated tags</description>

		<description>Don&#039;t quote me on this, but if I remember correctly, I first learned about the need for Modernizr to be up top in the Html5 Boilerplate comments. It&#039;s a good project to look through just for ideas and the comments, even if you don&#039;t use it.
Oh, and WatchMeCode looks really interesting! I&#039;m definitely going to have to check it out. Thanks.</description>

		<description>If you&#039;re just using Modernizr for its shimming capabilities, you might want to check out HTML5Shim ( http://code.google.com/p/html5shim/ ). It, too, brings IE up-to-date with the new HTML5 elements, but is a little lighter-weight than Modernizr.

Oh, and don&#039;t forget to put it in your &lt;head&gt;, too. :)</description>
