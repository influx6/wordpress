		<description>I&#039;ve seen that delete mistake a couple of places recently... here&#039;s a very thorough article that also explains why the firebug console has a misleading quirk on the issue.

		<description>I&#039;m not sure I can directly answer your question, but I ran across this article today and though it might be useful: http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/08/finding-memory-leaks.html</description>

		<description>right - i always forget about that, for some reason. a &quot;var&quot; will fall out of scope, though, and be cleaned up, when the function exits (assuming no closures on the var). 

there was an article I read a while back that talked about &quot;delete&quot; great detail, but i can&#039;t seem to find it anymore.</description>

		<description>I think it is worth mentioning that “you can force a variable to be de-referenced and allow the thing it points to be cleaned up by using the delete keyword in JavaScript: `delete myVar`” will not work with variables declared with `var`. As `delete` works with properties of objects (and in case of non `var` declaration the declared variable is actually a part of global object [`window` in browsers]). </description>

		<description>Is there an easy way in something like Chrome&#039;s web inspector to check if a particular object has been properly cleaned up? I&#039;m thinking something like:

- navigate to a view plus model in my backbone app
- open the web inspector and look at the view and model somewhere
- navigate to a different view
- use the web inspector to check the old view and model have been GC&#039;d

Being able to do that would really help me understand/play with GC to get my head around it better.</description>
