		<description>@Derick
Definitely on the tie in, will add a link from my one cause this is a great example. Forgot it was the comment on your other post that made me want to finish the blog entry (otherwise it would have stayed as a draft forever). Definitely hope the pattern makes it into a future version of DDD or into the much anticipated DDD forum FAQ.

Get you on the rest, if you&#039;re over-zealous then so am I...if there ever is an ALT.NET manifesto I actually hope over-zealous is in it :)</description>

&quot;looping through collections (or using Linq) is something I&#039;ve used quite a bit&quot;

same here. I really didn&#039;t mean to say that you should never do this. I was only trying to illustrate a specific example of how some simple changes in this instance (this post, and the previous) could represent a more clearly cut encapsulation of the business rules.

&quot;you have to sniff carefully&quot;

very true. i think i was getting a little over-zealous in trying to make my point. 

&quot;Consultation is probably a good example of the Relationship Object archetype that Randy Stafford discusssed&quot;

i was thinking the same thing after reading your post on making meaningful relationships. it&#039;s good to see these posts tie into each other so well. helps validate a lot of what i&#039;ve been thinking recently :)

		<description>&quot;that was the subject of the previous post, actually. We started with this in place and found that we had an opportunity to better encapsulate the knowledge of which consultation was the current one, and moved away from that.&quot;

Woops, I did read it but added comment late at nught so wasn&#039;t thinking clearly :)

I definitely get the performance issue but the encapsulation one I don&#039;t really follow fully. I must admit looping through collections (or using Linq) is something I&#039;ve used quite a bit, only falling back on anything more complicated when it was needed.

Whichever you go for though my real point was just that I find ease mapping can be a sign of a bad domain design but for complex parts of the model it can just be down to issues with the ORM or pain of impedance mismatch so you have to sniff carefully..</description>

		<description>Not arguing with the rest of it but in your options you missed an obvious one which is to pick the current consultation at run-time. 

The obvious argument is it could be slow but thats often premature optimization, been some good threads on this in the DDD forum and one piece of advice I value was that you should program as if everythings in memory. If you do that then you obviously need to test and optimize afterwards but its an approach that l&#039;ve seen that work an absolute treat. I&#039;d also argue that the where clause in the NHibernate mapping file is not a big problem, but its horses for courses.

I should also say that from what I&#039;ve seen often problems in the infrastructure and supporting roles are not really caused by design smells. Sometimes the best domain models are a pain to map if you just use straight NHibernate, what makes them great is that they elegantly solve the problem and build in real domain knowledge. My hope is that in the future NHibernate builds in more knowledge of DDD, if it did I think we&#039;d be flying.

That doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m arguing with your design ofcourse, I totally agree with the Consultation being key here and having seperate modules in play. I just think a good domain design (including good aggregate design) has more to do with the reflective part and that whether it maps well or not is sometimes a seperate issue.</description>
