		<description>@OJ

The very nature of delegates will always be a delayed execution of the code they point to, no matter the intended use of the delegate.

public void Foo(Action bar)
{
   bar();
}

or 

Action bar = new Action(someMethod);
bar();

these are the most basic examples of using a delegate, and both of them are illustrations of delayed code execution - whether it&#039;s one wait cycle that is imperceptable by a human is irrelevant. The runtime is delaying the execution of the delegate&#039;s target until the delegate is invoked.</description>

		<description>I think that your summation is PART of the answer, but not an answer as a whole. Delegates are used in scenarios where you are not delaying the execution of code, such as varying functionality based on state.</description>

		<description>Never thought about the &quot;delaying execution&quot;. Hummm thanks :)

		<description>Indeed, that characteristic of delegates came useful to an idea we are developing, which is basically a set of classes providing configuration APIs for setting up hierarchies of Windows Forms Controls. You don&#039;t really want to create the Control hierarchy when you are using the config API, instead delegates are set up in the proper way, and once the user calls the Setup(Control c) method all Action&lt;Control&gt; delegates created during the configuration can be executed. This also provides the advantage that youc an reuse such a Control Setup instance.</description>
