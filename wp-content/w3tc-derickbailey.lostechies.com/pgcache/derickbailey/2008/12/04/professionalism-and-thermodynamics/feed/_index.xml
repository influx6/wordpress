		<description>@Josh

&quot;Unfortunately, sometimes expending the energy necessary to offset entropy in an organization may be too great for an individual...leading to burn out.&quot;

very true. i&#039;ve burned out more than once in my continuous struggle. I&#039;m very fortunate in my current project to have a tech-lead who is fighting along side me.  even with a partner in the fight, burn-out is still a real possibility. It takes an entire team to fight the entropy, in my experience.</description>

		<description>I think I&#039;ve made a similar argument in the past.  In fact, I believe that entropy is a factor in any social entity and energy must constantly be expended to avert or lessen its effects.

		<description>One of the physics professors at my old uni named his house &quot;High Entropy&quot; on account of it always being in a state of disorder!</description>
