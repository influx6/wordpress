		<description>@Neil

Plus, nested classes are much more powerful in Ctrl+N - nested namespaces are pretty much hidden to R#.</description>

		<description>@Neil - true, you can search by file names. that does help a lot, but i sometimes end up with multiple classes in one file.</description>

		<description>Can&#039;t you just do Ctrl+Shift+N to search based on filename, for ValidationSpecs.cs</description>

		<description>I even go one step further - all specs in a for a given concern in one file.  I&#039;ve even tried it as far as &quot;spec file per feature&quot;.  Then nested classes group specific concerns, down to the lowest level.  The cool thing is that &quot;Ctrl+N&quot; works for nested classes - so I can have specs for a type spread across multiple different concerns, each with their own aspects for that feature located within the feature where it was relevant.

I haven&#039;t done it a whole lot, but it&#039;s kinda neat to see why some piece of code is important.</description>
