		<description>I also dislike the use of &quot;failure&quot; when applying creativity to solve problems.  I think of failure as &quot;capable of doing something, but not applying sufficient effort to perform the task&quot;, not &quot;create a solution for an unsolved problem&quot;.

I realize I&#039;m splitting semantic hairs here.  But I really think the choice of words affects our self-image and attitude.  Thomas Edison tried thousands of experiments to create the incandescent bulb.  When asked about his &quot;failures&quot;, he is reported to have said &quot;I have not failed 10,000 times.  I have found 10,000 solutions that do not work&quot;.

Likewise, I don&#039;t want to view product development that isn&#039;t accepted by the client as &quot;failures&quot;, especially considering that often the client doesn&#039;t know what they want until they see it.</description>

		<description>@Frank,

i like your point about reinforcement. success is a tremendously valuable thing for many different reasons, including that one. i&#039;m going to split hairs, though, and say that reinforcement and learning are separate (though related) concepts... that&#039;s such a minuscule point to debate, though. i think we agree, overall.

that sentence you quoted could certainly use a little less &quot;black vs. white&quot; tone, too. guess i didn&#039;t catch that one when i was proof reading yesterday. :)

@Urs,

I like your bullet points and very much agree with them. i don&#039;t agree that failure is not needed, though. short iterations and feedback loops of test first development provide the kind of micro-level failures that allow you to change and still accomplish your objectives. 

i think the word &#039;failure&#039; is stigmatized to a higher level, &quot;permanent&quot; state, which I don&#039;t really agree with anymore. i&#039;m not saying you should fail to deliver your project on time. i&#039;m saying the iterative, incremental approach to software development is a series of small failures that lead to much greater success through rapid learning on a small scale.</description>

		<description>Isn&#039;t there a better word for failure? Sounds far too strong for me. Something like &quot;in need of corrective action&quot; would better fit the bill, albeit not as clumsy. Also , I disagree a lil&#039; bit with this: &quot;If your first attempt and creating a solution is successful you have learned nothing.&quot; (sic) - You can learn a lot from the stuff you&#039;ve done right. It reinforces what is good. You can&#039;t live in failure all the time. You&#039;ll need to figure out the good stuff, too. The good stuff is e.g. short delivery cycles, because it helps you NOT to fail. Maybe I&#039;m saying the same thing, in which case I apologize.</description>

		<description>I should have read this article just a month ago. I failed in some ways to deliver what the customer needed. But there are just a few chances to work on those failures and improve the next delivery. 

&quot;Deliver fast and get feedback to deliver better the next time&quot; is going to be my motto of the year.</description>

		<description>Nice article.

I&#039;d like to add that there exist other options for individual learning:
- get a mentor/teacher/sensei/master/... who will show you something she knows but you don&#039;t.
- use e.g. Acceptance Test Driven Development to provide you with a frame within which you can experiment and learn without acctual failing (yeah, you will fail some tests ;-) ).

There is not always failure required,</description>

		<description>Thank, Derick.  This is more than a software development lesson, but a life lesson!</description>
