		<description> I had some confusion on what exactly this meant, mainly from omitting the body specifically . What James was saying is that you should omit the entire assignment of an It assertion.

It should_have_name_foo; 

Will show up as inconclusive on test runners.</description>

		<description>We just renamed out our FactAttribute to ThenAttribute and then subclassed that to EventuallyThenAttribute and added a message for all skipped tests. 

[Then] public void the_something_happens(){}

[EventuallyThen] public void the_something_happens(){}

We&#039;re dragging out feet on moving to MSpec as well. </description>

		<description>to the peeps that suggested Assert.Fail or throwing a NotImplementedException: you might want to read the blog post you are commenting on. :)

to everyone else: good suggestions! I&#039;m not a fan of Ignore, honestly. i think the semantics between ignore and not yet implemented are significant, but that would at least work. i&#039;ll have to try out the Assert.Inconclusive, too. I was not aware of that assertion.</description>

		<description>I second (third?) the call for the [Ignore] attribute.  I committed a few &quot;stub&quot; tests just last night using that approach. :) </description>

		<description>There is also the option of making the class or method under test throw a NotImplementedException and expect that exception in your test.</description>

		<description>MSpec already has this functionality. Simply declare but don&#039;t assign the It delegate:

It should_do_something_I_will_care_about_soon;

This will generate a not implemented message very similar to how RSpec does it. </description>

		<description>Have you considered Assert.Inconclusive(&quot;Not yet implemented&quot;)? This should give you the nice yellow test result you seek, and should work with existing CI software too.  It&#039;s definitely in NUnit 2.5, maybe 2.4 also.

IgnoreAttribute is also a good option, as other commenters have mentioned. There may be important semantic differences between Assert.Inconclusive() and IgnoreAttribute that I&#039;ve missed.    </description>

		<description>If you wanted failing tests to remind you where you left off, you could use Assert.Fail(&quot;Not yet implemented&quot;) in the test body.</description>
