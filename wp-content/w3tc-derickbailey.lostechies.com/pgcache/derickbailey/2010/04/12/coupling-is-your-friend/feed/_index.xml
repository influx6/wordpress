		<description>Good post.  I think this is a size of the lego blocks problem.
I have found with coupling, what we are really trying to achieve is to determine the correct size of the lego blocks we are creating.  

Creating things that are too loosely coupled is akin to creating very small lego blocks, and lots of them.  While this isolates change, it can also make it very difficult to build anything.

Creating things that are too highly coupled is akin to creating 1 or two huge lego blocks.  Also not very useful for building anything, and is highly susceptible to any changes.

Getting the right size of the blocks seems to be the key.  I have also found that certain parts of the application, should have different size blocks, if that makes sense.

You make a good point that not too many are aware of when they toss around words like loose coupling, but highly cohesive.</description>

		<description>Loosely coupled, highly cohesive should be the goal.  Not entirely decoupled, but coupled to the right things for the right reasons in the right places where it makes the most sense :)

See, it&#039;s just that easy :)</description>
