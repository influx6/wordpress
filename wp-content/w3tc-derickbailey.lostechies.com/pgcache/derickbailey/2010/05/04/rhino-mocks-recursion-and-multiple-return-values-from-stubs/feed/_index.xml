		<description>Have you used this stuff recently? You say &quot;It’s important to note that if you do not specify the number of times to repeat for the first stub, then the second stub will simply overwrite the first one&quot; but experience has been otherwise (the first one will be repeated every time unless I put .Repeat.Any() on the second one).</description>

		<description>@Erik - yes, but it would take somewhere in the neighborhood of 32,000 times to cause that. the typical use case for switching between login and launch view in our app is maybe a few times on average. even if they did that a few hundred times, it wouldn&#039;t be a big deal.

		<description>This is off topic, but isn&#039;t it theoretically possible for someone to flip back and forth between views enough to exhaust the stack?</description>
