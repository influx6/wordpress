Easily add Google Code Prettify to your WordPress site. Customize the coloring with easy with options powered by ThemeKit For WordPress.

== Description ==

Prettify is a WordPress plugin that automatically embeds the required javascript for Google Code Prettify. It also includes a preview of what your code will look like and the ability to customize the look by installing [ThemeKit For WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/themekit/). ThemeKit For WordPress is also on WordPress.org.

If you prefer you can run the plugin without ThemeKit and it will just use the default Prettify styles.

Features include:

* ThemeKit ready.
* Easy to use syntax and styling. 
* Same syntax highlighter as [css-tricks.com](http://css-tricks.com).

== Installation ==

1. Install Prettify For WordPress either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server
2. After activating Prettify you will be able to use the default styling.
3. If you would like the custom styler then you will also need [ThemeKit For WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/themekit/)
3. That's it.  You're ready to go!
4. Enjoy your syntax highlighter.
